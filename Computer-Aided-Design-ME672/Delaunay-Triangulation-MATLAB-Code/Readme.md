# **Delaunay triangulation - MATLAB Code**
A *Delaunay triangulation (DT)* is a particular way of joining a set of points to make a triangular mesh. This function is already availbale in MATLAB ([link](http://in.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/delaunay.html)). But this self-written code will help in understanding the concept of DT, as the source code is available. This is the easiest way of generating the  DT in 2D.

#### System Specs:
- Windows/Ubuntu OS (32/64 bits)
- MATLAB R2016a or higher
# How to run the code?
#### Steps:
**1.** Put the points in excel file and specify the location of points in matlab file *run_me*.

**2.** Once you run the code, the points will be saved in *output_DT.off* file. This file has indices of points for every triangle created.

**3.** This will also show the figure showing traingulated region for the given points.
